<pre><center><h2>Kutch literally means something which intermittently
 becomes wet and dry; a large part of this district is known 
as Rann of is a shallow wetland which submerges in water 
during the rainy season and becomes dry during other seasons. 
The Rann is famous for its marshy salt flats which become 
snow white after the shallow water dries up each season 
before the monsoon rains.
Best time to visit –October to March</h2></center>
