		<!-- Navigation bars are required to display user where they can go to on the website 
		nav tags are important because they increase accessibility of your site. When a screen reader which, say someone who doesn't
		have good vision is visiting your site and they're using some sort of text based way of interacting with the site and they can't see the graphics, 
		then the nav bar tells the reader that they're using, okay, everything inside this tag relates to navigation. So that's why we use a nav bar, for
		that semantic meaning of our tags.
		
		div tags are used to wrap content together
		-->
		<nav class="navbar navbar-default"> <!--  This class gives a decent look to nav bar to distinguish from rest of content -->
