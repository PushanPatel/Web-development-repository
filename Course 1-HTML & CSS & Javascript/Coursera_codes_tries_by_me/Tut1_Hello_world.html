<!-- img tag to paste an image (if file has spaces then turn it to underscore-->
<img src="iceland.jpg" width="50%"  /> <!--  width=50% means it will be 50% of the width of window( you dynamically change the width, there will be change in size of image -->
<!-- <img src="iceland.jpg" width="158px" /> --><!--  This way we hard code this image size to 158 pixels, so not responsive any more -->
<!-- You can also make an image a hyperlink by above changing the text in between a tag to the image code like: 
<a href="Tut1_about.html">
	<img src="iceland.jpg" width="158px" />
