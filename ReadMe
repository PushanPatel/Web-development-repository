This repository contains files that I had created while learning Responsive Website Development and Design Specialisation courses
from Coursera. Link: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/website-development 
The files in folder Coursera provided codes are the files that were provided by Coursera.
Rest files are written by me with various comments which are based on my understanding. Also, pictures that don't belong Coursera provided folder are owned by me.
These comments could be beneficial for the ones who want to learn or revise the concepts.

I had used Notepad++ as the text editor for the purpose.

The folder HeavenlyPlaces contains the project that I did in my seventh standard when HTML was taught to me for first time.
That is why the files won't contain any comments. As I did this course much later for the purpose of brushing up concepts and learning new ones
